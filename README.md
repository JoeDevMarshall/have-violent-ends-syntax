# have-violent-ends-syntax theme

A pair of themes created as a fun side project to serve as a reminder to be careful what we wish for when programming for AI or automation. With a color theme based off of HBO's Westworld series - this theme is for the Atom text editor . This syntax theme pairs with its UI theme "these-violent-delights-ui" both themes are a work in progress.
